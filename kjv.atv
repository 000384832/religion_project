Ge@1:1@In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Ge@1:2@And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Ge@1:3@And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Ge@1:4@And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
Ge@1:5@And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
Ge@1:6@And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
Ge@1:7@And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
Ge@1:8@And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
Ge@1:9@And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
Ge@1:10@And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
Ge@1:11@And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
Ge@1:12@And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
Ge@1:13@And the evening and the morning were the third day.
Ge@1:14@And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
Ge@1:15@And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
Ge@1:16@And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
Ge@1:17@And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
Ge@1:18@And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
Ge@1:19@And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
Ge@1:20@And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
Ge@1:21@And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
Ge@1:22@And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
Ge@1:23@And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
Ge@1:24@And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
Ge@1:25@And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
Ge@1:26@And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Ge@1:27@So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
Ge@1:28@And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Ge@1:29@And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
Ge@1:30@And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
Ge@1:31@And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Ge@2:1@Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
Ge@2:2@And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Ge@2:3@And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
Ge@2:4@These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
Ge@2:5@And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
Ge@2:6@But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Ge@2:7@And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
Ge@2:8@And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Ge@2:9@And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Ge@2:10@And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
Ge@2:11@The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
Ge@2:12@And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
Ge@2:13@And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
Ge@2:14@And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
Ge@2:15@And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
Ge@2:16@And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
Ge@2:17@But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
Ge@2:18@And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
Ge@2:19@And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
Ge@2:20@And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
Ge@2:21@And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
Ge@2:22@And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
Ge@2:23@And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Ge@2:24@Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
Ge@2:25@And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Ge@3:1@Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
Ge@3:2@And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
Ge@3:3@But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
Ge@3:4@And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
Ge@3:5@For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
Ge@3:6@And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
Ge@3:7@And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
Ge@3:8@And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
Ge@3:9@And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?
Ge@3:10@And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
Ge@3:11@And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
Ge@3:12@And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
Ge@3:13@And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
Ge@3:14@And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
Ge@3:15@And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Ge@3:16@Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
Ge@3:17@And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
Ge@3:18@Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
Ge@3:19@In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
Ge@3:20@And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Ge@3:21@Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
Ge@3:22@And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
Ge@3:23@Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
Ge@3:24@So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
Ge@4:1@And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
Ge@4:2@And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Ge@4:3@And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
Ge@4:4@And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
Ge@4:5@But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
Ge@4:6@And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
Ge@4:7@If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
Ge@4:8@And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
Ge@4:9@And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
Ge@4:10@And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
Ge@4:11@And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
Ge@4:12@When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
Ge@4:13@And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
Ge@4:14@Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
Ge@4:15@And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
Ge@4:16@And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
Ge@4:17@And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
Ge@4:18@And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
Ge@4:19@And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
Ge@4:20@And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
Ge@4:21@And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
Ge@4:22@And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
Ge@4:23@And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
Ge@4:24@If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
Ge@4:25@And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
Ge@4:26@And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
Ge@5:1@This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
Ge@5:2@Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
Ge@5:3@And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
Ge@5:4@And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:5@And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
Ge@5:6@And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:
Ge@5:7@And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:8@And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
Ge@5:9@And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:
Ge@5:10@And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:11@And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
Ge@5:12@And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:
Ge@5:13@And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:14@And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
Ge@5:15@And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
Ge@5:16@And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:17@And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
Ge@5:18@And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:
Ge@5:19@And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:20@And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
Ge@5:21@And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
Ge@5:22@And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:23@And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
Ge@5:24@And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
Ge@5:25@And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
Ge@5:26@And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:27@And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
Ge@5:28@And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
Ge@5:29@And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
Ge@5:30@And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
Ge@5:31@And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
Ge@5:32@And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Ge@6:1@And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
Ge@6:2@That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
Ge@6:3@And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
Ge@6:4@There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
Ge@6:5@And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
Ge@6:6@And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
Ge@6:7@And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
Ge@6:8@But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
Ge@6:9@These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
Ge@6:10@And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Ge@6:11@The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
Ge@6:12@And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
Ge@6:13@And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Ge@6:14@Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
Ge@6:15@And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
Ge@6:16@A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
Ge@6:17@And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
Ge@6:18@But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
Ge@6:19@And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Ge@6:20@Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
Ge@6:21@And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Ge@6:22@Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
Ge@7:1@And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
Ge@7:2@Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
Ge@7:3@Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
Ge@7:4@For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
Ge@7:5@And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
Ge@7:6@And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
Ge@7:7@And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Ge@7:8@Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
Ge@7:9@There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
Ge@7:10@And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
Ge@7:11@In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
Ge@7:12@And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
Ge@7:13@In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
Ge@7:14@They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
Ge@7:15@And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
Ge@7:16@And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
Ge@7:17@And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
Ge@7:18@And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
Ge@7:19@And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
Ge@7:20@Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
Ge@7:21@And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
Ge@7:22@All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
Ge@7:23@And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
Ge@7:24@And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Ge@8:1@And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
Ge@8:2@The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
Ge@8:3@And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
Ge@8:4@And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
Ge@8:5@And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
Ge@8:6@And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
Ge@8:7@And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
Ge@8:8@Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
Ge@8:9@But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
Ge@8:10@And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
Ge@8:11@And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
Ge@8:12@And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
Ge@8:13@And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
Ge@8:14@And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
Ge@8:15@And God spake unto Noah, saying,
Ge@8:16@Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
Ge@8:17@Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
Ge@8:18@And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
Ge@8:19@Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
Ge@8:20@And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Ge@8:21@And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
Ge@8:22@While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
Ge@9:1@And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
Ge@9:2@And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
Ge@9:3@Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
Ge@9:4@But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
Ge@9:5@And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
Ge@9:6@Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
Ge@9:7@And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
Ge@9:8@And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
Ge@9:9@And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
Ge@9:10@And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
Ge@9:11@And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
Ge@9:12@And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
Ge@9:13@I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
Ge@9:14@And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
Ge@9:15@And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
Ge@9:16@And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
Ge@9:17@And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
Ge@9:18@And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
Ge@9:19@These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
Ge@9:20@And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
Ge@9:21@And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
Ge@9:22@And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
Ge@9:23@And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
Ge@9:24@And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
Ge@9:25@And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
Ge@9:26@And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
Ge@9:27@God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
Ge@9:28@And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
Ge@9:29@And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
Ge@10:1@Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
Ge@10:2@The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
Ge@10:3@And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
Ge@10:4@And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
Ge@10:5@By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
Ge@10:6@And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
Ge@10:7@And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
Ge@10:8@And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Ge@10:9@He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
Ge@10:10@And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Ge@10:11@Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
Ge@10:12@And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
Ge@10:13@And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
Ge@10:14@And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
Ge@10:15@And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,
Ge@10:16@And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
Ge@10:17@And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
Ge@10:18@And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
Ge@10:19@And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
Ge@10:20@These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
Ge@10:21@Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
Ge@10:22@The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
Ge@10:23@And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
Ge@10:24@And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
Ge@10:25@And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
Ge@10:26@And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
Ge@10:27@And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
Ge@10:28@And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
Ge@10:29@And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
Ge@10:30@And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
Ge@10:31@These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
Ge@10:32@These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
Ge@11:1@And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
Ge@11:2@And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
Ge@11:3@And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
Ge@11:4@And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
Ge@11:5@And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
Ge@11:6@And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
Ge@11:7@Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
Ge@11:8@So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
Ge@11:9@Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
Ge@11:10@These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
Ge@11:11@And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:12@And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
Ge@11:13@And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:14@And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
Ge@11:15@And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:16@And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
Ge@11:17@And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:18@And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
Ge@11:19@And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:20@And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
Ge@11:21@And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:22@And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
Ge@11:23@And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:24@And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
Ge@11:25@And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
Ge@11:26@And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Ge@11:27@Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
Ge@11:28@And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
Ge@11:29@And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Ge@11:30@But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
Ge@11:31@And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
Ge@11:32@And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
Ge@12:1@Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
Ge@12:2@And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
Ge@12:3@And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
Ge@12:4@So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
Ge@12:5@And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
Ge@12:6@And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
Ge@12:7@And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
Ge@12:8@And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
Ge@12:9@And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
Ge@12:10@And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
Ge@12:11@And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
Ge@12:12@Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Ge@12:13@Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
Ge@12:14@And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
Ge@12:15@The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
Ge@12:16@And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
Ge@12:17@And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
Ge@12:18@And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
Ge@12:19@Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
Ge@12:20@And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
Ge@13:1@And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
Ge@13:2@And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
Ge@13:3@And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
Ge@13:4@Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
Ge@13:5@And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
Ge@13:6@And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
Ge@13:7@And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
Ge@13:8@And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.
Ge@13:9@Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
Ge@13:10@And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
Ge@13:11@Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Ge@13:12@Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
Ge@13:13@But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
Ge@13:14@And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
Ge@13:15@For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
Ge@13:16@And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
Ge@13:17@Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
Ge@13:18@Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.
Ge@14:1@And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
Ge@14:2@That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
Ge@14:3@All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Ge@14:4@Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
Ge@14:5@And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
Ge@14:6@And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
Ge@14:7@And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
Ge@14:8@And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
Ge@14:9@With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
Ge@14:10@And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
Ge@14:11@And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
Ge@14:12@And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
Ge@14:13@And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
Ge@14:14@And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
Ge@14:15@And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
Ge@14:16@And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
Ge@14:17@And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
Ge@14:18@And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
Ge@14:19@And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
Ge@14:20@And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
Ge@14:21@And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
Ge@14:22@And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
Ge@14:23@That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Ge@14:24@Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
Ge@15:1@After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
Ge@15:2@And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
Ge@15:3@And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Ge@15:4@And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
Ge@15:5@And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
Ge@15:6@And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
Ge@15:7@And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
Ge@15:8@And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
Ge@15:9@And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
Ge@15:10@And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
Ge@15:11@And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
Ge@15:12@And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
Ge@15:13@And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
Ge@15:14@And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
Ge@15:15@And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
Ge@15:16@But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
Ge@15:17@And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
Ge@15:18@In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
Ge@15:19@The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
Ge@15:20@And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
Ge@15:21@And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
Ge@16:1@Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
Ge@16:2@And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
Ge@16:3@And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
Ge@16:4@And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
Ge@16:5@And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
Ge@16:6@But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
Ge@16:7@And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
Ge@16:8@And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
Ge@16:9@And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
Ge@16:10@And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
Ge@16:11@And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
Ge@16:12@And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
Ge@16:13@And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
Ge@16:14@Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
Ge@16:15@And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
Ge@16:16@And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Ge@17:1@And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
Ge@17:2@And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
Ge@17:3@And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
Ge@17:4@As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
Ge@17:5@Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
Ge@17:6@And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
Ge@17:7@And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
Ge@17:8@And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
Ge@17:9@And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
Ge@17:10@This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
Ge@17:11@And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
Ge@17:12@And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
Ge@17:13@He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
Ge@17:14@And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
Ge@17:15@And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
Ge@17:16@And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
Ge@17:17@Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
Ge@17:18@And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
Ge@17:19@And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
Ge@17:20@And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
Ge@17:21@But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
Ge@17:22@And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
Ge@17:23@And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
Ge@17:24@And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Ge@17:25@And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
Ge@17:26@In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
Ge@17:27@And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Ge@18:1@And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
Ge@18:2@And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
Ge@18:3@And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Ge@18:4@Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
Ge@18:5@And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
Ge@18:6@And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
Ge@18:7@And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
Ge@18:8@And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
Ge@18:9@And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
Ge@18:10@And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
Ge@18:11@Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Ge@18:12@Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
Ge@18:13@And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
Ge@18:14@Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
Ge@18:15@Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
Ge@18:16@And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
Ge@18:17@And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
Ge@18:18@Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
Ge@18:19@For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
Ge@18:20@And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
Ge@18:21@I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
Ge@18:22@And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
Ge@18:23@And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
Ge@18:24@Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
Ge@18:25@That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
Ge@18:26@And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
Ge@18:27@And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:
Ge@18:28@Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
Ge@18:29@And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
Ge@18:30@And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
Ge@18:31@And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
Ge@18:32@And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
Ge@18:33@And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
Ge@19:1@And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
Ge@19:2@And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
Ge@19:3@And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
Ge@19:4@But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
Ge@19:5@And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
Ge@19:6@And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
Ge@19:7@And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
Ge@19:8@Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
Ge@19:9@And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
Ge@19:10@But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
Ge@19:11@And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
Ge@19:12@And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
Ge@19:13@For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
Ge@19:14@And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
Ge@19:15@And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
Ge@19:16@And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
Ge@19:17@And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
Ge@19:18@And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:
Ge@19:19@Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
Ge@19:20@Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
Ge@19:21@And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
Ge@19:22@Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
Ge@19:23@The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Ge@19:24@Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
Ge@19:25@And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
Ge@19:26@But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
Ge@19:27@And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
Ge@19:28@And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
Ge@19:29@And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
Ge@19:30@And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
Ge@19:31@And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Ge@19:32@Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Ge@19:33@And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Ge@19:34@And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
Ge@19:35@And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Ge@19:36@Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
Ge@19:37@And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
Ge@19:38@And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
Ge@20:1@And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
Ge@20:2@And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
Ge@20:3@But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
Ge@20:4@But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
Ge@20:5@Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
Ge@20:6@And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Ge@20:7@Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
Ge@20:8@Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
Ge@20:9@Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
Ge@20:10@And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
Ge@20:11@And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
Ge@20:12@And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
Ge@20:13@And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
Ge@20:14@And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
Ge@20:15@And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
Ge@20:16@And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
Ge@20:17@So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
Ge@20:18@For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
Ge@21:1@And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
Ge@21:2@For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
Ge@21:3@And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
Ge@21:4@And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
Ge@21:5@And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
Ge@21:6@And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
Ge@21:7@And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
Ge@21:8@And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
Ge@21:9@And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
Ge@21:10@Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
Ge@21:11@And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
Ge@21:12@And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
Ge@21:13@And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
Ge@21:14@And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Ge@21:15@And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
Ge@21:16@And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
Ge@21:17@And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Ge@21:18@Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
Ge@21:19@And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
Ge@21:20@And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
Ge@21:21@And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
Ge@21:22@And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
Ge@21:23@Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
Ge@21:24@And Abraham said, I will swear.
Ge@21:25@And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
Ge@21:26@And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.
Ge@21:27@And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
Ge@21:28@And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
Ge@21:29@And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
Ge@21:30@And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Ge@21:31@Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.
Ge@21:32@Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
Ge@21:33@And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
Ge@21:34@And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
Ge@22:1@And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
Ge@22:2@And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
Ge@22:3@And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Ge@22:4@Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
Ge@22:5@And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
Ge@22:6@And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
Ge@22:7@And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
Ge@22:8@And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
Ge@22:9@And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
Ge@22:10@And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
Ge@22:11@And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
Ge@22:12@And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
Ge@22:13@And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
Ge@22:14@And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
Ge@22:15@And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
Ge@22:16@And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
Ge@22:17@That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
Ge@22:18@And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
Ge@22:19@So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
Ge@22:20@And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
Ge@22:21@Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
Ge@22:22@And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
Ge@22:23@And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
Ge@22:24@And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
Ge@23:1@And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
Ge@23:2@And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
Ge@23:3@And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
Ge@23:4@I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
Ge@23:5@And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Ge@23:6@Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
Ge@23:7@And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
Ge@23:8@And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
Ge@23:9@That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
Ge@23:10@And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Ge@23:11@Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
Ge@23:12@And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
Ge@23:13@And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
Ge@23:14@And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Ge@23:15@My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
Ge@23:16@And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
Ge@23:17@And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
Ge@23:18@Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
Ge@23:19@And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
Ge@23:20@And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
Ge@24:1@And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
Ge@24:2@And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
Ge@24:3@And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
Ge@24:4@But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
Ge@24:5@And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
Ge@24:6@And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
Ge@24:7@The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
Ge@24:8@And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
Ge@24:9@And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
Ge@24:10@And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
Ge@24:11@And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
Ge@24:12@And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
Ge@24:13@Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
Ge@24:14@And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
Ge@24:15@And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
Ge@24:16@And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
Ge@24:17@And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
Ge@24:18@And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
Ge@24:19@And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
Ge@24:20@And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
Ge@24:21@And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
Ge@24:22@And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
Ge@24:23@And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
Ge@24:24@And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
Ge@24:25@She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
Ge@24:26@And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
Ge@24:27@And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
Ge@24:28@And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
Ge@24:29@And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
Ge@24:30@And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
Ge@24:31@And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
Ge@24:32@And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
Ge@24:33@And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
Ge@24:34@And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
Ge@24:35@And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
Ge@24:36@And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
Ge@24:37@And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
Ge@24:38@But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
Ge@24:39@And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
Ge@24:40@And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
Ge@24:41@Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
Ge@24:42@And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
Ge@24:43@Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
Ge@24:44@And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son.
Ge@24:45@And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
Ge@24:46@And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
Ge@24:47@And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
Ge@24:48@And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
Ge@24:49@And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Ge@24:50@Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Ge@24:51@Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
Ge@24:52@And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.
Ge@24:53@And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
Ge@24:54@And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
Ge@24:55@And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
Ge@24:56@And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
Ge@24:57@And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
Ge@24:58@And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Ge@24:59@And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
Ge@24:60@And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
Ge@24:61@And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
Ge@24:62@And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
Ge@24:63@And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
Ge@24:64@And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
Ge@24:65@For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
Ge@24:66@And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
Ge@24:67@And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
Ge@25:1@Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
Ge@25:2@And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
Ge@25:3@And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
Ge@25:4@And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
Ge@25:5@And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
Ge@25:6@But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
Ge@25:7@And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Ge@25:8@Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
Ge@25:9@And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
Ge@25:10@The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
Ge@25:11@And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.
Ge@25:12@Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
Ge@25:13@And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
Ge@25:14@And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Ge@25:15@Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
Ge@25:16@These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
Ge@25:17@And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
Ge@25:18@And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
Ge@25:19@And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
Ge@25:20@And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
Ge@25:21@And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
Ge@25:22@And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
Ge@25:23@And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
Ge@25:24@And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Ge@25:25@And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
Ge@25:26@And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
Ge@25:27@And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
Ge@25:28@And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Ge@25:29@And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
Ge@25:30@And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
Ge@25:31@And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
Ge@25:32@And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
Ge@25:33@And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Ge@25:34@Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
Ge@26:1@And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
Ge@26:2@And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
Ge@26:3@Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
Ge@26:4@And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
Ge@26:5@Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
Ge@26:6@And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
Ge@26:7@And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
Ge@26:8@And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
Ge@26:9@And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
Ge@26:10@And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
Ge@26:11@And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Ge@26:12@Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
Ge@26:13@And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
Ge@26:14@For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
Ge@26:15@For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
Ge@26:16@And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
Ge@26:17@And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
Ge@26:18@And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
Ge@26:19@And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
Ge@26:20@And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
Ge@26:21@And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
Ge@26:22@And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
Ge@26:23@And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
Ge@26:24@And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
Ge@26:25@And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
Ge@26:26@Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
Ge@26:27@And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
Ge@26:28@And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
Ge@26:29@That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.
Ge@26:30@And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
Ge@26:31@And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
Ge@26:32@And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
Ge@26:33@And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
Ge@26:34@And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
Ge@26:35@Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Ge@27:1@And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
Ge@27:2@And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
Ge@27:3@Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
Ge@27:4@And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
Ge@27:5@And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
Ge@27:6@And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Ge@27:7@Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
Ge@27:8@Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Ge@27:9@Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
Ge@27:10@And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
Ge@27:11@And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
Ge@27:12@My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
Ge@27:13@And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
Ge@27:14@And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
Ge@27:15@And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
Ge@27:16@And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
Ge@27:17@And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
Ge@27:18@And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
Ge@27:19@And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Ge@27:20@And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.
Ge@27:21@And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
Ge@27:22@And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
Ge@27:23@And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
Ge@27:24@And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
Ge@27:25@And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
Ge@27:26@And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
Ge@27:27@And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
Ge@27:28@Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
Ge@27:29@Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
Ge@27:30@And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
Ge@27:31@And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
Ge@27:32@And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
Ge@27:33@And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
Ge@27:34@And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
Ge@27:35@And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
Ge@27:36@And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
Ge@27:37@And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
Ge@27:38@And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
Ge@27:39@And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
Ge@27:40@And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
Ge@27:41@And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
Ge@27:42@And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
Ge@27:43@Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
Ge@27:44@And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;
Ge@27:45@Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
Ge@27:46@And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
Ge@28:1@And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Ge@28:2@Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
Ge@28:3@And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
Ge@28:4@And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
Ge@28:5@And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
Ge@28:6@When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
Ge@28:7@And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;
Ge@28:8@And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
Ge@28:9@Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
Ge@28:10@And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
Ge@28:11@And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
Ge@28:12@And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Ge@28:13@And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
Ge@28:14@And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
Ge@28:15@And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
Ge@28:16@And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
Ge@28:17@And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
Ge@28:18@And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
Ge@28:19@And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
Ge@28:20@And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
Ge@28:21@So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
Ge@28:22@And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
Ge@29:1@Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
Ge@29:2@And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
Ge@29:3@And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.
Ge@29:4@And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
Ge@29:5@And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
Ge@29:6@And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
Ge@29:7@And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
Ge@29:8@And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
Ge@29:9@And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
Ge@29:10@And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
Ge@29:11@And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
Ge@29:12@And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.
Ge@29:13@And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
Ge@29:14@And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
Ge@29:15@And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
Ge@29:16@And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Ge@29:17@Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
Ge@29:18@And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
Ge@29:19@And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
Ge@29:20@And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
Ge@29:21@And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
Ge@29:22@And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
Ge@29:23@And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
Ge@29:24@And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.
Ge@29:25@And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
Ge@29:26@And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Ge@29:27@Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
Ge@29:28@And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
Ge@29:29@And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
Ge@29:30@And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
Ge@29:31@And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.
Ge@29:32@And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
Ge@29:33@And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
Ge@29:34@And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
Ge@29:35@And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
Ge@30:1@And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
Ge@30:2@And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
Ge@30:3@And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
Ge@30:4@And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
Ge@30:5@And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
Ge@30:6@And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
Ge@30:7@And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
Ge@30:8@And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
Ge@30:9@When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
Ge@30:10@And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.
Ge@30:11@And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
Ge@30:12@And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.
Ge@30:13@And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
Ge@30:14@And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
Ge@30:15@And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
Ge@30:16@And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
Ge@30:17@And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
Ge@30:18@And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
Ge@30:19@And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
Ge@30:20@And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
Ge@30:21@And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
Ge@30:22@And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
Ge@30:23@And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
Ge@30:24@And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.
Ge@30:25@And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Ge@30:26@Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
Ge@30:27@And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
Ge@30:28@And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
Ge@30:29@And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
Ge@30:30@For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
Ge@30:31@And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.
Ge@30:32@I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
Ge@30:33@So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
Ge@30:34@And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
Ge@30:35@And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
Ge@30:36@And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
Ge@30:37@And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
Ge@30:38@And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
Ge@30:39@And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
Ge@30:40@And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
Ge@30:41@And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
Ge@30:42@But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
Ge@30:43@And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.
Ge@31:1@And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.
Ge@31:2@And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
Ge@31:3@And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
Ge@31:4@And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
Ge@31:5@And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
Ge@31:6@And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
Ge@31:7@And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
Ge@31:8@If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
Ge@31:9@Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
Ge@31:10@And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
Ge@31:11@And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
Ge@31:12@And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
Ge@31:13@I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
Ge@31:14@And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
Ge@31:15@Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
Ge@31:16@For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
Ge@31:17@Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
Ge@31:18@And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
Ge@31:19@And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
Ge@31:20@And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
Ge@31:21@So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.
Ge@31:22@And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
Ge@31:23@And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
Ge@31:24@And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Ge@31:25@Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
Ge@31:26@And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
Ge@31:27@Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
Ge@31:28@And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
Ge@31:29@It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Ge@31:30@And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
Ge@31:31@And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
Ge@31:32@With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
Ge@31:33@And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
Ge@31:34@Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
Ge@31:35@And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
Ge@31:36@And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
Ge@31:37@Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
Ge@31:38@This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
Ge@31:39@That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
Ge@31:40@Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
Ge@31:41@Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Ge@31:42@Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
Ge@31:43@And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
Ge@31:44@Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
Ge@31:45@And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
Ge@31:46@And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
Ge@31:47@And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
Ge@31:48@And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
Ge@31:49@And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
Ge@31:50@If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
Ge@31:51@And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:
Ge@31:52@This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
Ge@31:53@The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
Ge@31:54@Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
Ge@31:55@And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
Ge@32:1@And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
Ge@32:2@And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
Ge@32:3@And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
Ge@32:4@And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
Ge@32:5@And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
Ge@32:6@And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Ge@32:7@Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
Ge@32:8@And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
Ge@32:9@And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
Ge@32:10@I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
Ge@32:11@Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
Ge@32:12@And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
Ge@32:13@And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
Ge@32:14@Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
Ge@32:15@Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
Ge@32:16@And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
Ge@32:17@And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
Ge@32:18@Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.
Ge@32:19@And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
Ge@32:20@And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
Ge@32:21@So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
Ge@32:22@And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
Ge@32:23@And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
Ge@32:24@And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
Ge@32:25@And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
Ge@32:26@And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
Ge@32:27@And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
Ge@32:28@And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
Ge@32:29@And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
Ge@32:30@And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
Ge@32:31@And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
Ge@32:32@Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
Ge@33:1@And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
Ge@33:2@And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
Ge@33:3@And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
Ge@33:4@And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
Ge@33:5@And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
Ge@33:6@Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
Ge@33:7@And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
Ge@33:8@And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
Ge@33:9@And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
Ge@33:10@And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Ge@33:11@Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
Ge@33:12@And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
Ge@33:13@And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
Ge@33:14@Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
Ge@33:15@And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
Ge@33:16@So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
Ge@33:17@And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
Ge@33:18@And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.
Ge@33:19@And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
Ge@33:20@And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
Ge@34:1@And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
Ge@34:2@And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
Ge@34:3@And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
Ge@34:4@And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
Ge@34:5@And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
Ge@34:6@And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
Ge@34:7@And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
Ge@34:8@And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
Ge@34:9@And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
Ge@34:10@And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
Ge@34:11@And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Ge@34:12@Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
Ge@34:13@And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
Ge@34:14@And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:
Ge@34:15@But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;
Ge@34:16@Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
Ge@34:17@But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
Ge@34:18@And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
Ge@34:19@And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.
Ge@34:20@And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
Ge@34:21@These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Ge@34:22@Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
Ge@34:23@Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
Ge@34:24@And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
Ge@34:25@And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
Ge@34:26@And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
Ge@34:27@The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
Ge@34:28@They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,
Ge@34:29@And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
Ge@34:30@And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
Ge@34:31@And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
Ge@35:1@And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Ge@35:2@Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
Ge@35:3@And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
Ge@35:4@And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
Ge@35:5@And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
Ge@35:6@So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
Ge@35:7@And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
Ge@35:8@But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.
Ge@35:9@And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.
Ge@35:10@And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
Ge@35:11@And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Ge@35:12@And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
Ge@35:13@And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
Ge@35:14@And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
Ge@35:15@And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
Ge@35:16@And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
Ge@35:17@And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
Ge@35:18@And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.
Ge@35:19@And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
Ge@35:20@And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
Ge@35:21@And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
Ge@35:22@And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
Ge@35:23@The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
Ge@35:24@The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
Ge@35:25@And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
Ge@35:26@And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.
Ge@35:27@And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
Ge@35:28@And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
Ge@35:29@And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Ge@36:1@Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
Ge@36:2@Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
Ge@36:3@And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
Ge@36:4@And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;
Ge@36:5@And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
Ge@36:6@And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
Ge@36:7@For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle.
Ge@36:8@Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
Ge@36:9@And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
Ge@36:10@These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
Ge@36:11@And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
Ge@36:12@And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
Ge@36:13@And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
Ge@36:14@And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
Ge@36:15@These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
Ge@36:16@Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.
Ge@36:17@And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
Ge@36:18@And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
Ge@36:19@These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.
Ge@36:20@These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,
Ge@36:21@And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
Ge@36:22@And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna.
Ge@36:23@And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
Ge@36:24@And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
Ge@36:25@And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
Ge@36:26@And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
Ge@36:27@The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.
Ge@36:28@The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.
Ge@36:29@These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
Ge@36:30@Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
Ge@36:31@And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
Ge@36:32@And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Ge@36:33@And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
Ge@36:34@And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
Ge@36:35@And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
Ge@36:36@And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
Ge@36:37@And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
Ge@36:38@And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
Ge@36:39@And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
Ge@36:40@And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
Ge@36:41@Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
Ge@36:42@Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,
Ge@36:43@Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
Ge@37:1@And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
Ge@37:2@These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
Ge@37:3@Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
Ge@37:4@And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
Ge@37:5@And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
Ge@37:6@And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
Ge@37:7@For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
Ge@37:8@And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
Ge@37:9@And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
Ge@37:10@And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
Ge@37:11@And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
Ge@37:12@And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
Ge@37:13@And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
Ge@37:14@And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
Ge@37:15@And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
Ge@37:16@And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
Ge@37:17@And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
Ge@37:18@And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
Ge@37:19@And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
Ge@37:20@Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
Ge@37:21@And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
Ge@37:22@And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
Ge@37:23@And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
Ge@37:24@And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
Ge@37:25@And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
Ge@37:26@And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
Ge@37:27@Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
Ge@37:28@Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
Ge@37:29@And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
Ge@37:30@And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
Ge@37:31@And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
Ge@37:32@And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
Ge@37:33@And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
Ge@37:34@And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
Ge@37:35@And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
Ge@37:36@And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
Ge@38:1@And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
Ge@38:2@And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
Ge@38:3@And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
Ge@38:4@And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
Ge@38:5@And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
Ge@38:6@And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
Ge@38:7@And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
Ge@38:8@And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
Ge@38:9@And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
Ge@38:10@And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
Ge@38:11@Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
Ge@38:12@And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
Ge@38:13@And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
Ge@38:14@And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
Ge@38:15@When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
Ge@38:16@And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
Ge@38:17@And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
Ge@38:18@And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
Ge@38:19@And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
Ge@38:20@And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
Ge@38:21@Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.
Ge@38:22@And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
Ge@38:23@And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
Ge@38:24@And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
Ge@38:25@When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
Ge@38:26@And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
Ge@38:27@And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
Ge@38:28@And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
Ge@38:29@And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
Ge@38:30@And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
Ge@39:1@And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.
Ge@39:2@And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
Ge@39:3@And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
Ge@39:4@And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
Ge@39:5@And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.
Ge@39:6@And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.
Ge@39:7@And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
Ge@39:8@But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;
Ge@39:9@There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
Ge@39:10@And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
Ge@39:11@And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
Ge@39:12@And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
Ge@39:13@And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
Ge@39:14@That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
Ge@39:15@And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.
Ge@39:16@And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
Ge@39:17@And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
Ge@39:18@And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.
Ge@39:19@And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
Ge@39:20@And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
Ge@39:21@But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
Ge@39:22@And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
Ge@39:23@The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.
Ge@40:1@And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
Ge@40:2@And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
Ge@40:3@And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
Ge@40:4@And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.
Ge@40:5@And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.
Ge@40:6@And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
Ge@40:7@And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?
Ge@40:8@And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
Ge@40:9@And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
Ge@40:10@And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
Ge@40:11@And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
Ge@40:12@And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:
Ge@40:13@Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
Ge@40:14@But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
Ge@40:15@For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
Ge@40:16@When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
Ge@40:17@And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
Ge@40:18@And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:
Ge@40:19@Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
Ge@40:20@And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
Ge@40:21@And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
Ge@40:22@But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Ge@40:23@Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
Ge@41:1@And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
Ge@41:2@And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
Ge@41:3@And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
Ge@41:4@And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
Ge@41:5@And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
Ge@41:6@And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
Ge@41:7@And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
Ge@41:8@And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
Ge@41:9@Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
Ge@41:10@Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
Ge@41:11@And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
Ge@41:12@And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
Ge@41:13@And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
Ge@41:14@Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
Ge@41:15@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
Ge@41:16@And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
Ge@41:17@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
Ge@41:18@And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
Ge@41:19@And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
Ge@41:20@And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
Ge@41:21@And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Ge@41:22@And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
Ge@41:23@And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
Ge@41:24@And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
Ge@41:25@And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
Ge@41:26@The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
Ge@41:27@And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
Ge@41:28@This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
Ge@41:29@Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
Ge@41:30@And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
Ge@41:31@And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
Ge@41:32@And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Ge@41:33@Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:34@Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
Ge@41:35@And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
Ge@41:36@And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
Ge@41:37@And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
Ge@41:38@And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
Ge@41:39@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
Ge@41:40@Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
Ge@41:41@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:42@And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
Ge@41:43@And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:44@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:45@And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:46@And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:47@And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
Ge@41:48@And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
Ge@41:49@And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
Ge@41:50@And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
Ge@41:51@And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
Ge@41:52@And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
Ge@41:53@And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
Ge@41:54@And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
Ge@41:55@And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
Ge@41:56@And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
Ge@41:57@And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
Ge@42:1@Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
Ge@42:2@And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
Ge@42:3@And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
Ge@42:4@But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
Ge@42:5@And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
Ge@42:6@And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
Ge@42:7@And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
Ge@42:8@And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
Ge@42:9@And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Ge@42:10@And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
Ge@42:11@We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
Ge@42:12@And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
Ge@42:13@And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
Ge@42:14@And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
Ge@42:15@Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Ge@42:16@Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
Ge@42:17@And he put them all together into ward three days.
Ge@42:18@And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
Ge@42:19@If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
Ge@42:20@But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
Ge@42:21@And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
Ge@42:22@And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
Ge@42:23@And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
Ge@42:24@And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
Ge@42:25@Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
Ge@42:26@And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
Ge@42:27@And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
Ge@42:28@And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
Ge@42:29@And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
Ge@42:30@The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
Ge@42:31@And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:
Ge@42:32@We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
Ge@42:33@And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
Ge@42:34@And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
Ge@42:35@And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
Ge@42:36@And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
Ge@42:37@And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
Ge@42:38@And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Ge@43:1@And the famine was sore in the land.
Ge@43:2@And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
Ge@43:3@And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Ge@43:4@If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
Ge@43:5@But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
Ge@43:6@And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
Ge@43:7@And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
Ge@43:8@And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
Ge@43:9@I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
Ge@43:10@For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
Ge@43:11@And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
Ge@43:12@And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
Ge@43:13@Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
Ge@43:14@And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
Ge@43:15@And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
Ge@43:16@And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
Ge@43:17@And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
Ge@43:18@And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
Ge@43:19@And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
Ge@43:20@And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
Ge@43:21@And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
Ge@43:22@And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
Ge@43:23@And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
Ge@43:24@And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
Ge@43:25@And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
Ge@43:26@And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
Ge@43:27@And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
Ge@43:28@And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
Ge@43:29@And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
Ge@43:30@And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
Ge@43:31@And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
Ge@43:32@And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Ge@43:33@And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
Ge@43:34@And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
Ge@44:1@And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
Ge@44:2@And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
Ge@44:3@As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
Ge@44:4@And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Ge@44:5@Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
Ge@44:6@And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
Ge@44:7@And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
Ge@44:8@Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
Ge@44:9@With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
Ge@44:10@And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
Ge@44:11@Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
Ge@44:12@And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
Ge@44:13@Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
Ge@44:14@And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
Ge@44:15@And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
Ge@44:16@And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
Ge@44:17@And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Ge@44:18@Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.
Ge@44:19@My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
Ge@44:20@And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
Ge@44:21@And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
Ge@44:22@And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
Ge@44:23@And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
Ge@44:24@And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
Ge@44:25@And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
Ge@44:26@And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
Ge@44:27@And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
Ge@44:28@And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
Ge@44:29@And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Ge@44:30@Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
Ge@44:31@It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
Ge@44:32@For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
Ge@44:33@Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
Ge@44:34@For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
Ge@45:1@Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
Ge@45:2@And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
Ge@45:3@And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
Ge@45:4@And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Ge@45:5@Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
Ge@45:6@For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.
Ge@45:7@And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
Ge@45:8@So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Ge@45:9@Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
Ge@45:10@And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
Ge@45:11@And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
Ge@45:12@And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
Ge@45:13@And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
Ge@45:14@And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Ge@45:15@Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
Ge@45:16@And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
Ge@45:17@And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
Ge@45:18@And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Ge@45:19@Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Ge@45:20@Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
Ge@45:21@And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
Ge@45:22@To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
Ge@45:23@And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
Ge@45:24@So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
Ge@45:25@And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
Ge@45:26@And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
Ge@45:27@And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
Ge@45:28@And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
Ge@46:1@And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
Ge@46:2@And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
Ge@46:3@And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
Ge@46:4@I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
Ge@46:5@And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
Ge@46:6@And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
Ge@46:7@His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
Ge@46:8@And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
Ge@46:9@And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
Ge@46:10@And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
Ge@46:11@And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Ge@46:12@And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
Ge@46:13@And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
Ge@46:14@And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
Ge@46:15@These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
Ge@46:16@And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
Ge@46:17@And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
Ge@46:18@These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
Ge@46:19@The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
Ge@46:20@And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
Ge@46:21@And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
Ge@46:22@These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
Ge@46:23@And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
Ge@46:24@And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
Ge@46:25@These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
Ge@46:26@All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
Ge@46:27@And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
Ge@46:28@And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
Ge@46:29@And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
Ge@46:30@And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.
Ge@46:31@And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
Ge@46:32@And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
Ge@46:33@And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
Ge@46:34@That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
Ge@47:1@Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
Ge@47:2@And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
Ge@47:3@And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
Ge@47:4@They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
Ge@47:5@And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
Ge@47:6@The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
Ge@47:7@And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Ge@47:8@And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
Ge@47:9@And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
Ge@47:10@And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
Ge@47:11@And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
Ge@47:12@And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
Ge@47:13@And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
Ge@47:14@And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
Ge@47:15@And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
Ge@47:16@And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
Ge@47:17@And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
Ge@47:18@When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Ge@47:19@Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
Ge@47:20@And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
Ge@47:21@And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
Ge@47:22@Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
Ge@47:23@Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
Ge@47:24@And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
Ge@47:25@And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
Ge@47:26@And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
Ge@47:27@And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
Ge@47:28@And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
Ge@47:29@And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
Ge@47:30@But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
Ge@47:31@And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
Ge@48:1@And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
Ge@48:2@And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
Ge@48:3@And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Ge@48:4@And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
Ge@48:5@And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
Ge@48:6@And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
Ge@48:7@And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
Ge@48:8@And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
Ge@48:9@And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Ge@48:10@Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
Ge@48:11@And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
Ge@48:12@And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
Ge@48:13@And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
Ge@48:14@And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
Ge@48:15@And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
Ge@48:16@The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Ge@48:17@And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
Ge@48:18@And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
Ge@48:19@And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
Ge@48:20@And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Ge@48:21@And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Ge@48:22@Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
Ge@49:1@And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
Ge@49:2@Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Ge@49:3@Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Ge@49:4@Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
Ge@49:5@Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
Ge@49:6@O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
Ge@49:7@Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Ge@49:8@Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
Ge@49:9@Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
Ge@49:10@The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.

Ge@49:14@Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
Ge@49:15@And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Ge@49:16@Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

Ge@49:21@Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Ge@49:22@Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
Ge@49:23@The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
Ge@49:24@But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
Ge@49:25@Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
Ge@49:26@The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Ge@49:27@Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
Ge@49:28@All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
Ge@49:29@And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
Ge@49:30@In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
Ge@49:31@There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
Ge@49:32@The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
Ge@49:33@And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
Ge@50:1@And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
Ge@50:2@And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
Ge@50:3@And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
Ge@50:4@And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
Ge@50:5@My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
Ge@50:6@And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
Ge@50:7@And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
Ge@50:8@And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
Ge@50:9@And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
Ge@50:10@And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
Ge@50:11@And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
Ge@50:12@And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
Ge@50:13@For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
Ge@50:14@And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
Ge@50:15@And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
Ge@50:16@And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
Ge@50:17@So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
Ge@50:18@And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
Ge@50:19@And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
Ge@50:20@But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
Ge@50:21@Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
Ge@50:22@And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
Ge@50:23@And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
Ge@50:24@And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
Ge@50:25@And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
Ge@50:26@So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Isa@3:23@The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
Isa@3:24@And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
Isa@3:25@Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
Isa@3:26@And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
Isa@4:1@And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
Isa@4:2@In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
Isa@4:3@And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
Isa@4:4@When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
Isa@4:5@And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.
Isa@4:6@And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
Isa@5:1@Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
Isa@5:2@And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
Isa@5:3@And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
Isa@5:4@What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
Isa@5:5@And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
Isa@5:6@And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
Isa@5:7@For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
Isa@5:8@Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
Isa@5:9@In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
Isa@5:10@Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
Isa@5:11@Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!
Isa@5:12@And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
Isa@5:13@Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
Isa@5:14@Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
Isa@5:15@And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
Isa@5:16@But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
Isa@5:17@Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
Isa@5:18@Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
Isa@5:19@That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!
Isa@5:20@Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
Isa@5:21@Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Isa@5:22@Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
Isa@5:23@Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
Isa@5:24@Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@5:25@Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isa@5:26@And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
Isa@5:27@None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Isa@5:28@Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
Isa@5:29@Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
Isa@5:30@And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
Isa@6:1@In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
Isa@6:2@Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
Isa@6:3@And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
Isa@6:4@And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Isa@6:5@Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
Isa@6:6@Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
Isa@6:7@And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
Isa@6:8@Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
Isa@6:9@And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
Isa@6:10@Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
Isa@6:11@Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
Isa@6:12@And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
Isa@6:13@But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
Isa@7:1@And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
Isa@7:2@And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
Isa@7:3@Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
Isa@7:4@And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
Isa@7:5@Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
Isa@7:6@Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
Isa@7:7@Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
Isa@7:8@For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
Isa@7:9@And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
Isa@7:10@Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
Isa@7:11@Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
Isa@7:12@But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
Isa@7:13@And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
Isa@7:14@Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
Isa@7:15@Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
Isa@7:16@For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
Isa@7:17@The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
Isa@7:18@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
Isa@7:19@And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
Isa@7:20@In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
Isa@7:21@And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
Isa@7:22@And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
Isa@7:23@And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
Isa@7:24@With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
Isa@7:25@And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
Isa@8:1@Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.
Isa@8:2@And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
Isa@8:3@And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Mahershalalhashbaz.
Isa@8:4@For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
Isa@8:5@The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,
Isa@8:6@Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
Isa@8:7@Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:
Isa@8:8@And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
Isa@8:9@Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
Isa@8:10@Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
Isa@8:11@For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
Isa@8:12@Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
Isa@8:13@Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
Isa@8:14@And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Isa@8:15@And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
Isa@8:16@Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
Isa@8:17@And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
Isa@8:18@Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.
Isa@8:19@And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?
Isa@8:20@To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
Isa@8:21@And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
Isa@8:22@And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.
Isa@9:1@Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.
Isa@9:2@The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
Isa@9:3@Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
Isa@9:4@For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
Isa@9:5@For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.
Isa@9:6@For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
Isa@9:7@Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
Isa@9:8@The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
Isa@9:9@And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,
Isa@9:10@The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.
Isa@9:11@Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
Isa@9:12@The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isa@9:13@For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.
Isa@9:14@Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.
Isa@9:15@The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
Isa@9:16@For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
Isa@9:17@Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isa@9:18@For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.
Isa@9:19@Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.
Isa@9:20@And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
Isa@9:21@Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isa@10:1@Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;
Isa@10:2@To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!
Isa@10:3@And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?
Isa@10:4@Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
Isa@10:5@O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
Isa@10:6@I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
Isa@10:7@Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
Isa@10:8@For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?
Isa@10:9@Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?
Isa@10:10@As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
Isa@10:11@Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
Isa@10:12@Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.
Isa@10:13@For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:
Isa@10:14@And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
Isa@10:15@Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.
Isa@10:16@Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
Isa@10:17@And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
Isa@10:18@And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
Isa@10:19@And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.
Isa@10:20@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
Isa@10:21@The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
Isa@10:22@For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
Isa@10:23@For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.
Isa@10:24@Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
Isa@10:25@For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.
Isa@10:26@And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
Isa@10:27@And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
Isa@10:28@He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:
Isa@10:29@They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
Isa@10:30@Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
Isa@10:31@Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.
Isa@10:32@As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Isa@10:33@Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
Isa@10:34@And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
Isa@11:1@And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
Isa@11:2@And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
Isa@11:3@And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
Isa@11:4@But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
Isa@11:5@And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
Isa@11:6@The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
Isa@11:7@And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
Isa@11:8@And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
Isa@11:9@They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
Isa@11:10@And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.
Isa@11:11@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
Isa@11:12@And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
Isa@11:13@The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
Isa@11:14@But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
Isa@11:15@And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod.
Isa@11:16@And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
Isa@12:1@And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
Isa@12:2@Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.
Isa@12:3@Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
Isa@12:4@And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
Isa@12:5@Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth.
Isa@12:6@Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
Isa@13:1@The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
Isa@13:2@Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
Isa@13:3@I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.
Isa@13:4@The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
Isa@13:5@They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.
Isa@13:6@Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
Isa@13:7@Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:
Isa@13:8@And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.
Isa@13:9@Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
Isa@13:10@For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
Isa@13:11@And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
Isa@13:12@I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
Isa@13:13@Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

Isa@13:19@And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
Isa@13:20@It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
Isa@13:21@But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
Isa@13:22@And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

Isa@14:9@Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
Isa@14:10@All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
Isa@14:11@Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
Isa@14:12@How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
Isa@14:13@For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
Isa@14:14@I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
Isa@14:15@Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

Isa@14:19@But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
Isa@14:20@Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
Isa@14:21@Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.

Isa@15:3@In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.
Isa@15:4@And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.
Isa@15:5@My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

Isa@15:7@Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
Isa@15:8@For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.
Isa@15:9@For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
Isa@16:1@Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
Isa@16:2@For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
Isa@16:3@Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.
Isa@16:4@Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
Isa@16:5@And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.
Isa@16:6@We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.
Isa@16:7@Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.
Isa@16:8@For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.
Isa@16:9@Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.
Isa@16:10@And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

Isa@17:10@Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips:

Isa@18:3@All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.
Isa@18:4@For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
Isa@18:5@For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.
Isa@18:6@They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
Isa@18:7@In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
Isa@19:1@The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
Isa@19:2@And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

Isa@19:5@And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.

Isa@19:7@The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.
Isa@19:8@The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
Isa@19:9@Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.
Isa@19:10@And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.
Isa@19:11@Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
Isa@19:12@Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.
Isa@19:13@The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.
Isa@19:14@The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.
Isa@19:15@Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
Isa@19:16@In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it.
Isa@19:17@And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.
Isa@19:18@In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.
Isa@19:19@In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.
Isa@19:20@And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
Isa@19:21@And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it.

Isa@19:23@In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.
Isa@19:24@In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:
Isa@19:25@Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.
Isa@20:1@In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;
Isa@20:2@At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
Isa@20:3@And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;
Isa@20:4@So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
Isa@20:5@And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
Isa@20:6@And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
Isa@21:1@The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
Isa@21:2@A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
Isa@21:3@Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.
Isa@21:4@My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
Isa@21:5@Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.

Isa@21:7@And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:
Isa@21:8@And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:
Isa@21:9@And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.
Isa@21:10@O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.
Isa@21:11@The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
Isa@21:12@The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
Isa@21:13@The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.
Isa@21:14@The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
Isa@21:15@For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
Isa@21:16@For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:
Isa@21:17@And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.
Isa@22:1@The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?
Isa@22:2@Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
Isa@22:3@All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which have fled from far.
Isa@22:4@Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.
Isa@22:5@For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

Isa@22:12@And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:
Isa@22:13@And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die.
Isa@22:14@And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
Isa@22:15@Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,
Isa@22:16@What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock?
Isa@22:17@Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will surely cover thee.
Isa@22:18@He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.
Isa@22:19@And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull thee down.
Isa@22:20@And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:
Isa@22:21@And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
Isa@22:22@And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
Isa@22:23@And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.
Isa@22:24@And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.
Isa@22:25@In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa@23:1@The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
Isa@23:2@Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
Isa@23:3@And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.
Isa@23:4@Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.
Isa@23:5@As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
Isa@23:6@Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
Isa@23:7@Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.
Isa@23:8@Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?
Isa@23:9@The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.
Isa@23:10@Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.
Isa@23:11@He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.
Isa@23:12@And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.
Isa@23:13@Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.
Isa@23:14@Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
Isa@23:15@And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.
Isa@23:16@Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
Isa@23:17@And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
Isa@23:18@And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
Isa@24:1@Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
Isa@24:2@And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.
Isa@24:3@The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.
Isa@24:4@The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.
Isa@24:5@The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.
Isa@24:6@Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.
Isa@24:7@The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.
Isa@24:8@The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
Isa@24:9@They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.
Isa@24:10@The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.
Isa@24:11@There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
Isa@24:12@In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
Isa@24:13@When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.
Isa@24:14@They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
Isa@24:15@Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
Isa@24:16@From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
Isa@24:17@Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
Isa@24:18@And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
Isa@24:19@The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.
Isa@24:20@The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.
Isa@24:21@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
Isa@24:22@And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.
Isa@24:23@Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.
Isa@25:1@O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.
Isa@25:2@For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
Isa@25:3@Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
Isa@25:4@For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
Isa@25:5@Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
Isa@25:6@And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
Isa@25:7@And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
Isa@25:8@He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa@25:9@And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
Isa@25:10@For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
Isa@25:11@And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
Isa@25:12@And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
Isa@26:1@In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
Isa@26:2@Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
Isa@26:3@Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
Isa@26:4@Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:
Isa@26:5@For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.
Isa@26:6@The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
Isa@26:7@The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
Isa@26:8@Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
Isa@26:9@With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
Isa@26:10@Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
Isa@26:11@LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
Isa@26:12@LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
Isa@26:13@O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
Isa@26:14@They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
Isa@26:15@Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.
Isa@26:16@LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
Isa@26:17@Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
Isa@26:18@We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
Isa@26:19@Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
Isa@26:20@Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
Isa@26:21@For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
Isa@27:1@In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
Isa@27:2@In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
Isa@27:3@I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
Isa@27:4@Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together.
Isa@27:5@Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make peace with me.
Isa@27:6@He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
Isa@27:7@Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him?
Isa@27:8@In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
Isa@27:9@By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
Isa@27:10@Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
Isa@27:11@When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.
Isa@27:12@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
Isa@27:13@And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
Isa@28:1@Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!
Isa@28:2@Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
Isa@28:3@The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
Isa@28:4@And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
Isa@28:5@In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,
Isa@28:6@And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
Isa@28:7@But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
Isa@28:8@For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
Isa@28:9@Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
Isa@28:10@For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:
Isa@28:11@For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
Isa@28:12@To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
Isa@28:13@But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
Isa@28:14@Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.
Isa@28:15@Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:
Isa@28:16@Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.
Isa@28:17@Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
Isa@28:18@And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
Isa@28:19@From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.
Isa@28:20@For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
Isa@28:21@For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.
Isa@28:22@Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.
Isa@28:23@Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
Isa@28:24@Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?
Isa@28:25@When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?
Isa@28:26@For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.
Isa@28:27@For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
Isa@28:28@Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.
Isa@28:29@This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.
Isa@29:1@Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.
Isa@29:2@Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.
Isa@29:3@And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
Isa@29:4@And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
Isa@29:5@Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
Isa@29:6@Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
Isa@29:7@And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
Isa@29:8@It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
Isa@29:9@Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
Isa@29:10@For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.
Isa@29:11@And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
Isa@29:12@And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
Isa@29:13@Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
Isa@29:14@Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
Isa@29:15@Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?
Isa@29:16@Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
Isa@29:17@Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
Isa@29:18@And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.
Isa@29:19@The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@29:20@For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:
Isa@29:21@That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.
Isa@29:22@Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
Isa@29:23@But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
Isa@29:24@They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
Isa@30:1@Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:
Isa@30:2@That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
Isa@30:3@Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
Isa@30:4@For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
Isa@30:5@They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
Isa@30:6@The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.
Isa@30:7@For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.
Isa@30:8@Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:
Isa@30:9@That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:
Isa@30:10@Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
Isa@30:11@Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
Isa@30:12@Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
Isa@30:13@Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
Isa@30:14@And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.
Isa@30:15@For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.
Isa@30:16@But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
Isa@30:17@One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.
Isa@30:18@And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.
Isa@30:19@For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
Isa@30:20@And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
Isa@30:21@And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Isa@30:22@Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
Isa@30:23@Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
Isa@30:24@The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
Isa@30:25@And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Isa@30:26@Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
Isa@30:27@Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:
Isa@30:28@And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
Isa@30:29@Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
Isa@30:30@And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
Isa@30:31@For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.
Isa@30:32@And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
Isa@30:33@For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
Isa@31:1@Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
Isa@31:2@Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
Isa@31:3@Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.
Isa@31:4@For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
Isa@31:5@As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.
Isa@31:6@Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
Isa@31:7@For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
Isa@31:8@Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.
Isa@31:9@And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
Isa@32:1@Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
Isa@32:2@And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
Isa@32:3@And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
Isa@32:4@The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
Isa@32:5@The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.
Isa@32:6@For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
Isa@32:7@The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
Isa@32:8@But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
Isa@32:9@Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.
Isa@32:10@Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
Isa@32:11@Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.
Isa@32:12@They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
Isa@32:13@Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:
Isa@32:14@Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
Isa@32:15@Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
Isa@32:16@Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
Isa@32:17@And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
Isa@32:18@And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
Isa@32:19@When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
Isa@32:20@Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.
Isa@33:1@Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
Isa@33:2@O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
Isa@33:3@At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
Isa@33:4@And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
Isa@33:5@The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
Isa@33:6@And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.
Isa@33:7@Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
Isa@33:8@The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.
Isa@33:9@The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.
Isa@33:10@Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
Isa@33:11@Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.
Isa@33:12@And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
Isa@33:13@Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
Isa@33:14@The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
Isa@33:15@He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
Isa@33:16@He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
Isa@33:17@Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.
Isa@33:18@Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?
Isa@33:19@Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.
Isa@33:20@Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
Isa@33:21@But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
Isa@33:22@For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.
Isa@33:23@Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
Isa@33:24@And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
Isa@34:1@Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
Isa@34:2@For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
Isa@34:3@Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
Isa@34:4@And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.
Isa@34:5@For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
Isa@34:6@The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
Isa@34:7@And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
Isa@34:8@For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
Isa@34:9@And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
Isa@34:10@It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
Isa@34:11@But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
Isa@34:12@They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
Isa@34:13@And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls.
Isa@34:14@The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
Isa@34:15@There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
Isa@34:16@Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
Isa@34:17@And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
Isa@35:1@The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
Isa@35:2@It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.
Isa@35:3@Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Isa@35:4@Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
Isa@35:5@Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Isa@35:6@Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
Isa@35:7@And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
Isa@35:8@And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
Isa@35:9@No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
Isa@35:10@And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
Isa@36:1@Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
Isa@36:2@And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
Isa@36:3@Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.
Isa@36:4@And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
Isa@36:5@I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
Isa@36:6@Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
Isa@36:7@But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
Isa@36:8@Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
Isa@36:9@How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Isa@36:10@And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Isa@36:11@Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
Isa@36:12@But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
Isa@36:13@Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Isa@36:14@Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
Isa@36:15@Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isa@36:16@Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Isa@36:17@Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Isa@36:18@Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Isa@36:19@Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Isa@36:20@Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
Isa@36:21@But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Isa@36:22@Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Isa@37:1@And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
Isa@37:2@And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
Isa@37:3@And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
Isa@37:4@It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
Isa@37:5@So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
Isa@37:6@And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Isa@37:7@Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
Isa@37:8@So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
Isa@37:9@And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Isa@37:10@Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Isa@37:11@Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
Isa@37:12@Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
Isa@37:13@Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
Isa@37:14@And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
Isa@37:15@And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,
Isa@37:16@O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
Isa@37:17@Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.
Isa@37:18@Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
Isa@37:19@And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
Isa@37:20@Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.
Isa@37:21@Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
Isa@37:22@This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
Isa@37:23@Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@37:24@By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
Isa@37:25@I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
Isa@37:26@Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.
Isa@37:27@Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.
Isa@37:28@But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
Isa@37:29@Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
Isa@37:30@And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
Isa@37:31@And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
Isa@37:32@For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
Isa@37:33@Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
Isa@37:34@By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
Isa@37:35@For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
Isa@37:36@Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
Isa@37:37@So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
Isa@37:38@And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
Isa@38:1@In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
Isa@38:2@Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
Isa@38:3@And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
Isa@38:4@Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
Isa@38:5@Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
Isa@38:6@And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
Isa@38:7@And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
Isa@38:8@Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
Isa@38:9@The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:
Isa@38:10@I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
Isa@38:11@I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
Isa@38:12@Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isa@38:13@I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
Isa@38:14@Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.
Isa@38:15@What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
Isa@38:16@O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
Isa@38:17@Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
Isa@38:18@For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
Isa@38:19@The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
Isa@38:20@The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
Isa@38:21@For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.
Isa@38:22@Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
Isa@39:1@At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
Isa@39:2@And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.
Isa@39:3@Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
Isa@39:4@Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.
Isa@39:5@Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
Isa@39:6@Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
Isa@39:7@And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Isa@39:8@Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
Isa@40:1@Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
Isa@40:2@Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.
Isa@40:3@The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Isa@40:4@Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:
Isa@40:5@And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa@40:6@The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:
Isa@40:7@The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.
Isa@40:8@The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
Isa@40:9@O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
Isa@40:10@Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
Isa@40:11@He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
Isa@40:12@Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
Isa@40:13@Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him?
Isa@40:14@With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
Isa@40:15@Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
Isa@40:16@And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.
Isa@40:17@All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.
Isa@40:18@To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
Isa@40:19@The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
Isa@40:20@He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.
Isa@40:21@Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
Isa@40:22@It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
Isa@40:23@That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
Isa@40:24@Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
Isa@40:25@To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
Isa@40:26@Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
Isa@40:27@Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
Isa@40:28@Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
Isa@40:29@He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
Isa@40:30@Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
Isa@40:31@But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.
Isa@41:1@Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.
Isa@41:2@Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.
Isa@41:3@He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.
Isa@41:4@Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.
Isa@41:5@The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.
Isa@41:6@They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.
Isa@41:7@So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
Isa@41:8@But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.
Isa@41:9@Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
Isa@41:10@Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
Isa@41:11@Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.
Isa@41:12@Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
Isa@41:13@For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.
Isa@41:14@Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@41:15@Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
Isa@41:16@Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@41:17@When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
Isa@41:18@I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
Isa@41:19@I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:
Isa@41:20@That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
Isa@41:21@Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
Isa@41:22@Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.
Isa@41:23@Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
Isa@41:24@Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.
Isa@41:25@I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.
Isa@41:26@Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words.
Isa@41:27@The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.
Isa@41:28@For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.
Isa@41:29@Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.
Isa@42:1@Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
Isa@42:2@He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
Isa@42:3@A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
Isa@42:4@He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
Isa@42:5@Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
Isa@42:6@I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;
Isa@42:7@To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
Isa@42:8@I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.
Isa@42:9@Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
Isa@42:10@Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
Isa@42:11@Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
Isa@42:12@Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.
Isa@42:13@The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.
Isa@42:14@I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
Isa@42:15@I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
Isa@42:16@And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.
Isa@42:17@They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.
Isa@42:18@Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
Isa@42:19@Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?
Isa@42:20@Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.
Isa@42:21@The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.
Isa@42:22@But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
Isa@42:23@Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
Isa@42:24@Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.
Isa@42:25@Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
Isa@43:1@But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.
Isa@43:2@When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
Isa@43:3@For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
Isa@43:4@Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
Isa@43:5@Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
Isa@43:6@I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
Isa@43:7@Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
Isa@43:8@Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
Isa@43:9@Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
Isa@43:10@Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
Isa@43:11@I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.
Isa@43:12@I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.
Isa@43:13@Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?
Isa@43:14@Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.
Isa@43:15@I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
Isa@43:16@Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
Isa@43:17@Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.
Isa@43:18@Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
Isa@43:19@Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
Isa@43:20@The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.
Isa@43:21@This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.
Isa@43:22@But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
Isa@43:23@Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
Isa@43:24@Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
Isa@43:25@I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.
Isa@43:26@Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
Isa@43:27@Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
Isa@43:28@Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
Isa@44:1@Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
Isa@44:2@Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
Isa@44:3@For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:
Isa@44:4@And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
Isa@44:5@One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
Isa@44:6@Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.
Isa@44:7@And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.
Isa@44:8@Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.
Isa@44:9@They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
Isa@44:10@Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
Isa@44:11@Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.
Isa@44:12@The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
Isa@44:13@The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
Isa@44:14@He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.
Isa@44:15@Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
Isa@44:16@He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:
Isa@44:17@And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.
Isa@44:18@They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
Isa@44:19@And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
Isa@44:20@He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
Isa@44:21@Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
Isa@44:22@I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
Isa@44:23@Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
Isa@44:24@Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;
Isa@44:25@That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
Isa@44:26@That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
Isa@44:27@That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:
Isa@44:28@That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
Isa@45:1@Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;
Isa@45:2@I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
Isa@45:3@And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.
Isa@45:4@For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
Isa@45:5@I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
Isa@45:6@That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.
Isa@45:7@I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
Isa@45:8@Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.
Isa@45:9@Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?
Isa@45:10@Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?
Isa@45:11@Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.
Isa@45:12@I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
Isa@45:13@I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.
Isa@45:14@Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.
Isa@45:15@Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
Isa@45:16@They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.
Isa@45:17@But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.
Isa@45:18@For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.
Isa@45:19@I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
Isa@45:20@Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
Isa@45:21@Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.
Isa@45:22@Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
Isa@45:23@I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
Isa@45:24@Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.
Isa@45:25@In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
Isa@46:1@Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast.
Isa@46:2@They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
Isa@46:3@Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:
Isa@46:4@And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
Isa@46:5@To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
Isa@46:6@They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.
Isa@46:7@They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
Isa@46:8@Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
Isa@46:9@Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,
Isa@46:10@Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:
Isa@46:11@Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
Isa@46:12@Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:
Isa@46:13@I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
Isa@47:1@Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
Isa@47:2@Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
Isa@47:3@Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.
Isa@47:4@As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
Isa@47:5@Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
Isa@47:6@I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
Isa@47:7@And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.
Isa@47:8@Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:
Isa@47:9@But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
Isa@47:10@For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.
Isa@47:11@Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.
Isa@47:12@Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
Isa@47:13@Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
Isa@47:14@Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.
Isa@47:15@Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.
Isa@48:1@Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.
Isa@48:2@For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.
Isa@48:3@I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.
Isa@48:4@Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
Isa@48:5@I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
Isa@48:6@Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
Isa@48:7@They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
Isa@48:8@Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
Isa@48:9@For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
Isa@48:10@Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
Isa@48:11@For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.
Isa@48:12@Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
Isa@48:13@Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.
Isa@48:14@All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.
Isa@48:15@I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
Isa@48:16@Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
Isa@48:17@Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.
Isa@48:18@O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:
Isa@48:19@Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.
Isa@48:20@Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
Isa@48:21@And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
Isa@48:22@There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
Isa@49:1@Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
Isa@49:2@And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
Isa@49:3@And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
Isa@49:4@Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.
Isa@49:5@And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.
Isa@49:6@And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
Isa@49:7@Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
Isa@49:8@Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
Isa@49:9@That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
Isa@49:10@They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
Isa@49:11@And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
Isa@49:12@Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
Isa@49:13@Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
Isa@49:14@But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.
Isa@49:15@Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
Isa@49:16@Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
Isa@49:17@Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
Isa@49:18@Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.
Isa@49:19@For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
Isa@49:20@The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
Isa@49:21@Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
Isa@49:22@Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
Isa@49:23@And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
Isa@49:24@Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
Isa@49:25@But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
Isa@49:26@And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
Isa@50:1@Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
Isa@50:2@Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.
Isa@50:3@I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
Isa@50:4@The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
Isa@50:5@The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.
Isa@50:6@I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
Isa@50:7@For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
Isa@50:8@He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.
Isa@50:9@Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
Isa@50:10@Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.
Isa@50:11@Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
Isa@51:1@Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.
Isa@51:2@Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
Isa@51:3@For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
Isa@51:4@Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.
Isa@51:5@My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
Isa@51:6@Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
Isa@51:7@Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
Isa@51:8@For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.
Isa@51:9@Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?
Isa@51:10@Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?
Isa@51:11@Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
Isa@51:12@I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;
Isa@51:13@And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?
Isa@51:14@The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
Isa@51:15@But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.
Isa@51:16@And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
Isa@51:17@Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.
Isa@51:18@There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.
Isa@51:19@These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
Isa@51:20@Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
Isa@51:21@Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:
Isa@51:22@Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
Isa@51:23@But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
Isa@52:1@Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
Isa@52:2@Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
Isa@52:3@For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.
Isa@52:4@For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
Isa@52:5@Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.
Isa@52:6@Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I.
Isa@52:7@How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!
Isa@52:8@Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.
Isa@52:9@Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.
Isa@52:10@The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
Isa@52:11@Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.
Isa@52:12@For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.
Isa@52:13@Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
Isa@52:14@As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:
Isa@52:15@So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
Isa@53:1@Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
Isa@53:2@For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
Isa@53:3@He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
Isa@53:4@Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
Isa@53:5@But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
Isa@53:6@All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Isa@53:7@He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.
Isa@53:8@He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.
Isa@53:9@And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
Isa@53:10@Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.
Isa@53:11@He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
Isa@53:12@Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Isa@54:1@Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.
Isa@54:2@Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
Isa@54:3@For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
Isa@54:4@Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
Isa@54:5@For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.
Isa@54:6@For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.
Isa@54:7@For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
Isa@54:8@In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.
Isa@54:9@For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
Isa@54:10@For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
Isa@54:11@O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
Isa@54:12@And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.
Isa@54:13@And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.
Isa@54:14@In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
Isa@54:15@Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.
Isa@54:16@Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
Isa@54:17@No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Isa@55:1@Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
Isa@55:2@Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Isa@55:3@Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
Isa@55:4@Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.
Isa@55:5@Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
Isa@55:6@Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:
Isa@55:7@Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
Isa@55:8@For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD.
Isa@55:9@For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
Isa@55:10@For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:
Isa@55:11@So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
Isa@55:12@For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
Isa@55:13@Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
Isa@56:1@Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.
Isa@56:2@Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
Isa@56:3@Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
Isa@56:4@For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;
Isa@56:5@Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
Isa@56:6@Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;
Isa@56:7@Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
Isa@56:8@The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.
Isa@56:9@All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.
Isa@56:10@His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
Isa@56:11@Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.
Isa@56:12@Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.
Isa@57:1@The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
Isa@57:2@He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
Isa@57:3@But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.
Isa@57:4@Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
Isa@57:5@Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?
Isa@57:6@Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?
Isa@57:7@Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
Isa@57:8@Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
Isa@57:9@And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.
Isa@57:10@Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.
Isa@57:11@And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?
Isa@57:12@I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
Isa@57:13@When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;
Isa@57:14@And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.
Isa@57:15@For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
Isa@57:16@For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
Isa@57:17@For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
Isa@57:18@I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
Isa@57:19@I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.
Isa@57:20@But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
Isa@57:21@There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
Isa@58:1@Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.
Isa@58:2@Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
Isa@58:3@Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
Isa@58:4@Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.
Isa@58:5@Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
Isa@58:6@Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
Isa@58:7@Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
Isa@58:8@Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.
Isa@58:9@Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;
Isa@58:10@And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:
Isa@58:11@And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
Isa@58:12@And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
Isa@58:13@If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:
Isa@58:14@Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.
Isa@59:1@Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:
Isa@59:2@But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
Isa@59:3@For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.
Isa@59:4@None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
Isa@59:5@They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
Isa@59:6@Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
Isa@59:7@Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.
Isa@59:8@The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.
Isa@59:9@Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
Isa@59:10@We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.
Isa@59:11@We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
Isa@59:12@For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
Isa@59:13@In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
Isa@59:14@And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.
Isa@59:15@Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.
Isa@59:16@And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.
Isa@59:17@For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
Isa@59:18@According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.
Isa@59:19@So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
Isa@59:20@And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.
Isa@59:21@As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.
Isa@60:1@Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
Isa@60:2@For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
Isa@60:3@And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
Isa@60:4@Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.
Isa@60:5@Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.

Isa@63:18@The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
Isa@63:19@We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.
Isa@64:1@Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
Isa@64:2@As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!

Isa@64:9@Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
Isa@64:10@Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Isa@64:11@Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Isa@64:12@Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
Isa@65:1@I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.
Isa@65:2@I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
Isa@65:3@A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
Isa@65:4@Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
Isa@65:5@Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
Isa@65:6@Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
Isa@65:7@Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
Isa@65:8@Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
Isa@65:9@And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
Isa@65:10@And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
Isa@65:11@But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
Isa@65:12@Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.
Isa@65:13@Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
Isa@65:14@Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
Isa@65:15@And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
Isa@65:16@That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
Isa@65:17@For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
Isa@65:18@But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
Isa@65:19@And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
Isa@65:20@There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
Isa@65:21@And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
Isa@65:22@They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
Isa@65:23@They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
Isa@65:24@And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
Isa@65:25@The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
Isa@66:1@Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?
Isa@66:2@For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
Isa@66:3@He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
Isa@66:4@I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.
Isa@66:5@Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
Isa@66:6@A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
Isa@66:7@Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
Isa@66:8@Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
Isa@66:9@Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.
Isa@66:10@Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
Isa@66:11@That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
Isa@66:12@For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.
Isa@66:13@As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
Isa@66:14@And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.
Isa@66:15@For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
Isa@66:16@For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
Isa@66:17@They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
Isa@66:18@For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
Isa@66:19@And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
Isa@66:20@And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
Isa@66:21@And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD.
Isa@66:22@For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
Isa@66:23@And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
Isa@66:24@And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
